- **Sensor Examples**

| Sensor name | Working Principles | Advantage | Disadvantage | 
| ----------- | ------------------ |  -------- | ------------ | 
| Tactile Sensors | Contact closure, magnetic, piezo electric | Obstacle detection | ... |  
| Proximity Sensors | Reed switch, Hall effect, Inductive/Capacitive sensor | Obstacle avoidance | ... | 
| Infrared Sensors | emitting IR light and detecting reflections | Simplest non-contact sensor | Requires uniform surface, not absolutely reliable, short range |
| Sonar Sensor | emit chirp (1.2 ms), detect reflections |  | Uncertain direction, crosstalk, specular reflection, inconsistent speed of sound |
